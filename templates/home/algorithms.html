        <p class="w-75">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sample recommender, we use a TopPopular recommender where we rank the "popularity" of
            each song from <a href="https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017">Billboard Weekly Hot 100 Singles</a>
            and return the most popular songs. All songs are filtered first by their release dates: we assume the relevant
            timeframe for the parent's age to be from when they were
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/opinion/sunday/favorite-songs.html">15 years old</a>,
            to when they were 30. Songs are then filtered by the parent's preferred genres and artists,
            and ordered by their popularity, determined by: (1) number of weeks on chart, (2) average position, and
            (3) reoccurence. The songs are ordered to exclude seasonal songs with high reoccurence (e.g. Christmas carols),
            and to prioritize songs that were ranked higher on the chart for longer.

        <p class="w-75">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent-to-user recommender uses a hybrid approach, meaning that it uses both collaborative filtering (CF) 
            and content-based filtering (CBF) methods. We decided not to rely solely on CF methods like
            our <b>User-Parent</b> recommender does, due to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/neferfufi/lastfm">Last.fm</a>
            having a limited number of older (> 40) users.
        </p>

        <p class="w-75">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CF method uses <a href="https://github.com/lyst/lightfm">LightFM</a>[1], a Python recommender using matrix factorization for implicit feedback.
            Using <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">Spotipy</a> (Python library for
            <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify's Web API</a>),
            we get the parent's top tracks on Spotify, the artist for each track, and the number of tracks per artist.
            Last.fm data also contains each user's listening frequency for an artist, so we use this as the 'weight' for
            each artist, meaning that artists with higher frequency would be more important to a user.
            LightFM addresses the cold-start problem by grouping items that are liked by the same users,
            even if the items do not share similar features. To accelerate the recommender's performance, we ask for their
            user/child's age and only get Last.fm users within a similar age range (+-2 years).
            Each user-artist interaction in both Last.fm and the parent's listening history counts as a positive interaction
            (the user "likes" the artist) used to build LightFM's model. LightFM essentially represents each user and item (artist)
            as the sum of latent vectors, and finds the dot product of those representations using the equation:
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='eq1.png') }}">,
            with q<sub>u</sub> representing the user's latent representation,
            p<sub>i</sub> representing the item's representation, and with b<sub>u</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> each
            representing bias terms for the user and the item.
            We chose WARP (Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise) for the loss function, as it resulted in a higher AUC than
            BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking), the only other loss function suitable for this circumstance.
            For each user, the artists are ranked by the dot product; we get the artists with the highest dot product from this model.
        </p>

        <p class="w-75">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LightFM does have CBF functionality, but we found out that its item features implementation does not work as intended.
            So for the CBF method, we decided to use euclidean distance to calculate the distance between other songs and the parent's top tracks,
            using the songs' audio features from Spotify. From a list of artists (defaulted to 10, since Spotify only allows pulling audio
            information for up to 100 songs at a time), we get the top 10 songs for each artist on Spotify and compile a list of songs.
            We calculate the euclidean distance between those songs and the parent's preferred songs, using the formula
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='eq2.png') }}">, where p<sub>i</sub> and q<sub>i</sub> are the i<super>th</super>
            audio features from arbitrary song p and parent's song q, from 11 features (<i>danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness,  acousticness,
            instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo</i>). We get the minimum Euclidean distance from each song in the list
            to each of the parent's songs, and rank the songs by shortest distance to recommend songs that are the most
            similar to the parent's songs in terms of audio features.

        <p class="w-75">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We implement <a href="https://github.com/benfred/implicit">Implicit</a>[2] using <a href="https://medium.com/radon-dev/als-implicit-collaborative-filtering-5ed653ba39fe">alternating least squares</a>
            to build similarity between the user's playlist information and older users (users in the parent's age range) in the LastFM dataset.
            For our implicit feedback model, we use plays (number of interactions) as our "rating". Once we fit the model,
            we can now build recommendations for the particular user, in this case the user who has requested a playlist for
            their parent, and a list of recommended artists is returned. In our initial responses collected by the user,
            we collected the parent's favored genres so we use that data to filter down the recommended artists. We use
            Spotipy to collect the genre for each artist and we then filter the list of recommended artists down to artists
            that are represented by the favored genre of the parent. We can then use Spotify's top tracks to build a playlist from
            these filtered recommended artists to get a final list of songs that is outputted to a playlist on the user's Spotify account.
